          The 20th century saw the birth of one of the most important tools widely in use today
  called a computer. Today, computers are used for communication, management, research,
  drawing and design as well as entertainment.<br>
  This 21st century is being referred to as the digital age
  A computer is an electronic device that accepts user input (data) and processes it under
  the influence of a set of instructions referred to as programs to produce the desired output
  generally referred to as information.
          <ul>
          <li>
  Data are the raw facts may not make much meaning to the user.
        </li>
          <li>
   Programs are set of instructions that instruct a computer what to do.
        </li>
          <li>
  Information is result after data has been processed. 
          </li>

  There are 4 basic types of computer parts:
      <ol>
        <li>
  Input devices - parts of the computer that allow information or data to be given to
  the computer like keyboard or a mouse.
        </li>
        <li>
   Storage devices – parts of the computer that hold information. The primary
  storage device is the computer’s memory called RAM (random access memory).
  It remembers everything that is read, input, or output. But, because the
  computer’s memory is on a temporary area—it forgets everything when turned
  off—it must have another place to store information permanently. This secondary
          storage device is usually a disk.</li>
        <li>
   Processing device – part of the computer that processes and controls the flow of
  information; it actually does the work. The one part of the computer that handles
  this job is the central processing unit or CPU.
  d) Output devices - parts of the computer that gives out information generated by the computer, like a monitor, printer or speaker. </li>
    </ol>

          We shall also see how the various computers look like
  and the functions they perform in various organizations.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> Super computers</strong><br>
              Unlike mainframes and minicomputers, supercomputers are used for the heavy stuff like
  weather maps, construction of atom bombs, finding oil, earthquake prediction, and
  sciences where a lot of calculations must be done.
  They are also used to help governments eavesdrop on anything passing through
  telephone, data lines, e-mail, or radio waves; and anything that is written, etc.
  Historically, a supercomputer is associated with the fastest computer available or the
  largest in size.
  Supercomputing means "mass computing at ultra high speed." 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mini computers</strong><br>
              Introduced in the early 1960s and announced a new era in computing. They are relatively
  low cost and small. Historically, a mini is associated with de-centralized computing.
  Meaning most computing takes (physically) place on the mini itself 
              </li>
            <li>
  <strong>Micro computers</strong><br>
    A microcomputer is a computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit.
  Another general characteristic of these computers is that they occupy physically small
  amounts of space when compared to mainframe and minicomputers. <br>
    A microcomputer comes equipped with at least one type of data storage, usually RAM.
  Although some microcomputers (particularly early 8-bit home micros) perform tasks
  using RAM alone, some form of secondary storage is normally desirable. In the early
  days of home micros, this was often a data cassette deck (in many cases as an external
  unit). Later, secondary storage (particularly in the form of floppy disk and hard disk
  drives) were built in to the microcomputer case itself
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Laptops/notebooks </strong><br>
              A laptop computer or simply laptop (also notebook computer, notebook and notepad) is
  a small mobile computer, typically weighing 1.4 to 5.4 kg, although older laptops may
  weigh more.
  Laptops usually run on a single main battery or from an external AC/DC adapter that
  charges the battery while also supplying power to the computer itself even in the event of
  a power failure.
  Laptops contain components that are similar to their desktop counterparts and perform
  the same functions, but are miniaturized and optimized for mobile use and efficient power consumption, although typically less powerful for the same price. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mainframe computer</strong><br>Mainframes are computers used mainly by large organizations for critical applications,
  typically bulk data processing such as census, industry and consumer statistics, ERP, and
  financial transaction processing.
  The term probably originated from the early mainframes, as they were housed is enormous, room-sized metal boxes or frames. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cloud computing</strong><br>
                      Usually based up in the satellite and stores information instead of the common current
  ways of storages.

        <p> Their definitions and use.
  Typical pc hardware, mother-board, removable media devices such as CD, DVD will be
  explained. Students will also learn how to use floppy disks, USB Flash, internal storage sound card and networking.<br>
          <strong> Computer Hardware</strong><br>
  These are physical parts such as the system unit and peripheral devices. Peripheral
  devices connect to the system unit. They include:
          <ul>
            <li>
  Input devices
            </li>
            <li>
  Central processing
            </li>
            <li>
   Output devices
            </li>
            <li>
   Storage devices
            </li><br>
            Hardware is the physical parts of the computer like the monitor, keyboard, mouse,
  speakers, and of course the computer itself called the system unit. Hardware is also the
  parts inside the system unit that you can’t see unless you open.
            
  Computer hardware is the physical part of a computer, including its digital circuitry, as
  distinguished from the computer software that executes within the hardware. The hardware of a computer is infrequently changed</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Typical PC hardware</strong><br>
  A typical personal computer consists of a case or chassis in a tower shape (desktop) and the following parts.<br>
          <br>
          Motherboard - It is the "body" or mainframe of the computer, through which all other components interface.<br><br>
          Central processing unit (CPU) - Performs most of the calculations which enable a computer to function, sometimes referred to as the "brain" of the computer. <br><br>
            Computer fan - Used to lower the temperature of the computer; a fan is almost always attached to the CPU, and the computer case will generally have several fans to maintain constant airflow.<br><br>
  Random Access Memory (RAM)' - Fast-access memory that is cleared when the computer is powered-down. RAM attaches directly to the mother board, and is used to store programs that are currently running.<br><br>
          DVD-ROM Drive - a device used for reading data from a DVD.<br><br>
  DVD Writer - a device used for both reading and writing data to and from a DVD. DVDRAM Drive - a device used for rapid writing and reading of data from a special type of DVD.<br><br>
  Floppy disk - an outdated storage device consisting of a thin disk of a flexible magnetic storage medium.<br><br>
  Zip drive - an outdated medium-capacity removable disk storage system, first introduced by Iomega in 1994.<br><br>
  USB flash drive - a flash memory data storage device integrated with a USB interface,typically small, lightweight, removable, and rewritable.<br><br>
  Tape drive - a device that reads and writes data on a magnetic tape, usually used for long term storage. <br><br>
          </p>
        <p><strong>Internal storage</strong>
  Hardware that keeps data inside the computer for later use and remains persistent even when the computer has no power.<br>
  Hard disk - for medium-term storage of data.<br>
  Sound card Networking - Connects the computer to the Internet and/or other computers.<br>
  Modem - for dial-up connections<br>
  Network card - for DSL/Cable internet, and/or connecting to other computers Direct<br>
  Cable Connection - Use of a null modem, connecting two computers together using their serial ports or a Laplink Cable, connecting two computers together with their parallel ports.<br><br>
  Other peripherals
  In addition, hardware devices can include external components of a computer system.
  The following are either standard or very common.
  Includes various input and output devices, usually external to the computer system:<br>

        <p><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong><br>
  We are going to learn about the brain of a computer called the CPU. It is the brain of the computer because it is where data is manipulated and arithmetic and logic carried out.The central processing unit (CPU) also referred to as the processor is the central part of the computer where data processing takes part. It is regarded as the brain </p>
        <p><strong> Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)</strong><br>
  When the CU encounters an instruction that involves arithmetic or logic, it passes control to the 2nd components of the CPU – the ALU.
  ALU includes a group of registers which are memory locations built directly into the CPU that are used to hold data that are being processed by the current instruction. </p>
        <p><strong> Memory</strong><br>
  The CPU contains the Logic and Circuitry to run the computer but does not have room to store programs and data.The CPU contains registers for holding data and instructions.
  The CPU also requires space where it can holed whole programs and data being  manipulated by these programs.There are two types of memory – RAM and ROM </p>
